=== Notes by Chapter

* Chapter1
** You work for a software company
** (Diminishing) Value over time for ClosedSource technology, products, frameworks - OSS helps (community)!
** Disruption - Service Design and Tech evolution lowers the entry barrier, experimentation is cheap, try out fast with active users
** Organizational Agility:
*** Industrial era companies with hier and process gets efficiency at the cost of low agility.
*** Efficiency <--> Flexibility (Opp. ends)
** Conway’s law: “organizations which design systems…are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures
of these organizations.”
** Microservices Architecture: MSA is an approach to building software systems that decomposes business domain models into smaller,
consistent, bounded-contexts implemented by services. Isolated, autonomous services with some piece of biz functions - each team manages internal implementation detail with services contract communicated via _promises_
** Watch-out for Microservices code smell.footnote:[Shared-libraries, Enterprise-wide canonical models, JIRA change tickets, Single db access?]
** 5 main things when building MSA:
*** Design for Faults: Things _will_ fail, handle failure not just prevent it.
***** Network failures with IOException, Cascading failures from downstream services.
*** Design with Dependencies in mind:
***** loose coupling in our teams, in our technology, and our governance
***** One of the principles of creativity is to drop a constraint.footnote:[Dependency Oriented Thinking, Ganesh Prasad]. You can come up with creative solutions to problems if
you mentally eliminate one or more dependencies.
***** Abstract out the dependency on legacy systems. Backend data, calls, formats...
*** Design with domain in mind
